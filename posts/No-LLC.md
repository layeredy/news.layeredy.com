# Why We're No Longer a Company/LLC

As part of discontinuing many of our sub-projects, we will also be dissolving the company legally. 

## Why We're Doing This:
Primarily, this decision started from the increasing difficulty of running a small company in the US. As we mentioned in ["Infrequent Updates"](https://news.layeredy.com/#read/No-Updates), our small team has been struggling with time.

Additionally, our experience with our legal partner has been very difficult, and continuing with them is no longer viable. Quotes for transitioning to a new partner range from $4,000 to $5,000 (USD), which is not viable for us financially.

## Will This Affect You?
This change should not impact customers or users of our software. Even if we have billing challenges related to this dissolution, we are committed to keeping all of our software open-source so it stays accessible to everyone.
