## Why there haven't been very many updates to Layeredy (and associated projects)

* **Limited Team Size:** Layeredy is primarily run by a small team (2-3 people) who are also working on other projects, school, and work.
* **Open-Source:** Since most our software is open-source, we don't make anything from much of it.

**UptimeMatrix's release deadline is still Q1 2025.**  (+ you can use UptimeMatrix in earlytest [here](https://app.uptimematrix.com))

### **How You Can Help:**

* **Contribute Code:** As our projects are open-source, you can submit pull requests on [GitHub](https://lyrdy.co/gh). Usually, pull requests are reviewed and decisions are made within 3-4 business days.
* **Share Your Ideas:** Create an issue on [GitHub](https://lyrdy.co/gh) to suggest a feature or report a bug
* **Financial Support:** If you don't have time or knowledge to code or suggest ideas, consider supporting us financially. Our paid plans offer the same software with hosting and maintenance. Check out UptimeMatrix's plans [here](https://lyrdy.co/r5yc) (they start at US$10/mo)
