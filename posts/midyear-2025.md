# Mid-year review
More information on the future of Layeredy and updates planned

## Announce
There are currently no planned updates to Announce other than a better mobile UI

## Uptime
Uptime 4x is still being actively worked on with many of the bugs from 3x fixed. Uptime will also now have a free tier. We do not currently have an ETA for the release of Uptime 4x and do not recommend using Uptime 3x. Uptime 2x still works and integrations are relatively easy to make.
