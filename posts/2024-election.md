#### At Layeredy, we’re backing Kamala Harris for President.


## LGBTQ+ Rights:
We believe everyone deserves equal rights. No one should face discrimination for who they are. We proudly support LGBT+ rights through regular donations to The Trevor Project ([our donations](https://impact.layeredy.com/donations)), ensuring LGBTQ+ youth have access to essential resources and community.

## Opposing Project 2025:
Project 2025 aims to reverse progress on personal freedoms and civil rights. Layeredy stands against it and trusts Harris to protect individual rights.

## Small Businesses:
Small businesses like ours struggle with policies that favor the wealthiest. Harris has a strong track record of supporting small businesses, and we’re confident she’ll create better and more fair economic policies for all.

## Some other stuff:
There’s a lot more that drives our support for Kamala Harris beyond these points. From environmental policy to data privacy and consumer protection, there are countless ways we believe her leadership aligns with the future we want to help build. As always, we’re focused on helping rights, fairness, and opportunities for everyone; big and small, tech or not.
