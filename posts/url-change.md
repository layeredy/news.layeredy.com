# URL Update (October 22nd, 2024)

All URL structures for Layeredy-owned services have been updated. For example, "uptimematrix.com" now redirects to "uptimematrix.layeredy.com," and this change applies across all platforms and services under the Layeredy brand. Users accessing older URLs will be automatically redirected to the new Layeredy-specific subdomains.


# Edit (October 25th, 2024)
This change will be reverted on October 28th, 2024 due to some issues. We do not plan to switch back to using this structure. 

# Edit 2 (March 11, 2025)
We have started using layeredy.com/(product) as part of the rebrand of our services
