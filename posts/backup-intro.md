# Welcome, Backup

Backup provides an easy way to backup your Pterodactyl servers. With a simple setup, reliable backups, and easy restoration when you need it most.

## Backup (Community) | ([link](https://lyrdy.co/backupCE))
Backup for communities is designed to integrate with any Pterodactyl based server host. All you need is a **user** API key (You can get a user key at panel.example.com/account/api (replacing panel.example.com with your host's URL)). 

## Backup (Hosts) | ([link](https://lyrdy.co/backupHE))
Backup for hosts is designed to backup your entire Pterodactyl based host. It uses the admin API & SSH/SCP. Backup for hosts is designed to help you restore service as soon as possible in the event of a drive failure, for a user's request, or for any other data loss.
