# Account migrations & Privacy Policy updates

As outlined in [this forum post](https://forum.layeredy.com/index.php?route=/forum/topic/28-scheduled-maintenance---june-1%2C-2025-/). We will be doing scheduled maintenance on all systems. This will include moving user data to Clerk to provide a better experience so you do not need a seperate account for each app/service.

**This change required a change of our Privacy Policy which can be read [here](https://layeredy.com/privacy/)**

## What does this mean for you?
- **Account Migration**: Your existing account will be migrated to Clerk. You will not need to create a new account.
- **Single Sign-On**: You will be able to use the same account across all Layeredy services.
