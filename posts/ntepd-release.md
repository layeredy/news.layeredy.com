# ntepd release
ntepd (pronounced as notepad) is a modern, minimalist, and private notepad software that supports markdown.

We plan to release ntepd updates every few months and are working on desktop/mobile applications for all the main platforms. (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android). The Linux application has already been finished and is available [here](https://github.com/ntepd/linux)


ntepd is fully open source and built on Python, HTML, CSS, JS, and Electron.
